# Logic

*Where The Database Is A Truth Table*

## Overview

This dataset has been created for testing the support of boolean logic in Fussy.

There are two variants:

#### Boolean

Example using a boolean truth table to find the most probable logical operator(s) from facts.

#### Fuzzy

"Fuzzy logic is a form of many-valued logic; it deals with reasoning that is approximate rather than fixed and exact" (Wikipedia).

In this example, a numerical truth table is used instead of a boolean one.

Note: For the moment there is a bug in Fussy (which is still in beta, and experimental state)
and zero (0) is not supported, so I used other arbitrary random values to substitute true and false:

  - True becomes 4.2
  - False becomes 6.6
