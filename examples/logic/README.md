# Logic

*Where The Database Is A Truth Table*

## Dataset Information

This dataset has been created for testing the support of boolean logic in Fussy.

Original Truth Table data from Wikipedia, converted to CSV.

There are two different examples:

#### Boolean

Example using a boolean truth table to learn rules.

#### Fuzzy

*"Fuzzy logic is a form of many-valued logic; it deals with reasoning that is approximate rather than fixed and exact"* (Wikipedia, /Fuzzy_logic).

In this example, a numerical truth table is used instead of a boolean one.

For the moment there is a bug in Fussy (which is still in beta, and experimental state)
and zero (0) is not supported, so I used other random values to substitute true and false:
  - True becomes 4.2
  - False becomes 6.6
